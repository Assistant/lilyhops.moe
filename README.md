It's a little rough around the edges since I challenged myself to use many technologies I hadn't before, including [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/) ([Preact](https://preactjs.com/)), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/).

It is simply meant to be a passion project, and I will continue to pour my love into it.
